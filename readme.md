# C++ Class Work Repository

Welcome to the C++ Class Work Repository! This repository contains code assignments assigned by Dr. Francis Kambiri Mzembe.

## About the Course

This repository is dedicated to the C++ course instructed by Dr. Francis Kambiri Mzembe. Throughout this course, you will learn fundamental concepts of C++ programming language, including but not limited to:

- Basic syntax and structure of C++ programs
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Data structures and algorithms in C++
- Memory management and pointers
- Input/output operations
- Exception handling

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the assignments given in the course. Each directory contains the source code files (.cpp), header files (.h), and any additional resources required for the assignment. The directory structure may vary depending on the assignment requirements.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code assignments:
